							<strong style={{ color: 'var(--pb)' }}>telehealth a reality</strong> and improve the quality,
							equity, and affordability of healthcare worldwide. With skyrocketing costs, regulatory changes, and

						<p className='aboutTextBoxLine'>
							In addition to reducing overhead costs per visit, telehealth is less time-consuming, both for the
							patient and provider. Telehealth can allow physicians to bill for uncompensated phone calls while
							also extending hours to capture more billable time. Telehealth cuts down on no-shows and can
							improve the efficiency of a practice. Telehealth can also provide a competitive advantage,
							attracting and retaining more patients with new models of care.
